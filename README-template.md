## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learnt how to use media queries to achieve responsiveness across different devices. This is not my first project using them but it reinforced what I had done previously.  This project also helped me to revise on CSS Positioning and CSS centering.

### Continued development

I am learning more about CSS Grid and media queries. I am also learning Saas and will be using these skills in my future projects.
